Cloudant Seattle Office Updates

We want to move the video conferencing system to the large space near the front door. 

Additionally, we want to get a maid/cleaning service that comes into the office once or twice per week, which does full-service (dishes).  


## Prerequisite

In order to move the video conferencing system to the front room, we want to have the door at the stairwell locked and equipped with a doorbell for Cloudant and for the building's landlord. Since we intend to expand, eventually, into the landlord's large unused office space, we will eventually want this reconfigured. Additionally, its quite a hassle to always bring your key to the bathroom (although, this is done at rackspace with rfid card readers. the bathrooms are outside of the main office space.)

* doorbell moved
* lock installed on stairway door
